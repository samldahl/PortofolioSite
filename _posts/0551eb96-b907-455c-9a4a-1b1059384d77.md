# By Sam Lerdahl

Let’s be honest: an **“AI influencer” is a bot selling you something.**

It’s not revolutionary. It’s just advertising in a new mask. We’ve dressed up the same old tactic in synthetic skin and called it innovation. But at its core, it’s still something (or someone) nudging you with an opinion that is bought and paid for.

And maybe that’s the real problem.

# Ads Don’t Build Trust — People Do

**Word of Mouth.**  
The original marketing.

Before the opaque phrase “marketing” could be used to rationalize over-zealous claims and other “truths” peddled by someone on salary to have an opinion, conversation was just conversation. Before everything had to be a million-dollar idea, scale 10x, return shareholder value — it was simply a product people loved to talk about.

That’s marketing at the root, and it’s the only honest marketing that matters.

Your marketing is only as good as it is honest. But when we outsource that influence to artificial people — ones who don’t feel, don’t live, and don’t care — what does that say about the product?

And maybe more importantly: **what does it say about the team behind it?**

# If It Needs a Bot to Sell, Maybe It’s Not That Good

The best products don’t need to scream. They’re shared by people who actually use them. They grow through love, not hype. Through honesty, not illusion.

If your product needs a fake personality to convince real people to buy it, maybe the issue isn’t exposure — maybe it’s the product.

There are plenty of reasons why products don’t sell:

- Your product sucks (it’s not the right solution to a real problem)
- It’s not competitively priced (it’s typically overbuilt)
- You’re not solving a real issue (model won’t model)

We’ve gotten so enamored with growth at all costs that sometimes we forget a business should be **profitable out of the box**. Anyone arguing that this is “antique” is probably more focused on selling than serving others.

The modern market demands that we compete like this, considering how much the world spends selling every year. It’s tough when trust becomes a Jenga tower — seeing how much soul we can pull out of an operation while still making it “feel” like something it’s not.

“Look how tall it is! Isn’t this better for everyone?”

We’ve all been called by chatbots. It’s a gross feeling when companies use a computer to reach out with something that *sounds like you* — like your time is worth the same as a computer’s. (It’s not.)

All in the name of “efficiency” and “cost savings” that you somehow never feel.  
Maybe it’s all just inflation?

# Content vs. Connection

No amount of flashy edits, AI-generated faces, or dopamine-pumping, “life-changing” testimonials will fix the deeper truth:

**Happiness doesn’t come from stuff. And we know it.**

People don’t need more content.  
They need more *meaning*.

Some of the happiest people I know have less than me.  
Some of the most miserable people I know have more.

It’s the things you can’t buy — gratitude, contentment — that bring real peace. Sure, your product helps. But if you start cutting corners at the expense of your end users in the quest for margin and shareholder value, is the entity really a friend of the people it serves?

You could argue a business doesn’t have these responsibilities. But a business is tied to people — and I hope those people want the best for me.

# AI Influence Is the Wrong Kind of Automation

It’s not just that AI influencers are fake.  
It’s that they erode trust in what’s real.

And they’re made by people chasing money over morals, who’ll say things like:

> “Man’s gotta make a living, feed his family.”

…as if they couldn’t do anything else.

There are plenty of ways to make money.  
There are not a ton of ways to get *rich* quickly.

Maybe the faster someone wants to grow, the more willing they are to sell snake oil. I’d love to see that study.

I’d rather you sell QLEDs as OLEDs on Marketplace than generate someone who looks like me talking about a soda nobody wants for $4.99 because GPT told you I was asking about probiotic drinks.

At least the scammers on Marketplace **know** they’re scamming.  
(I got scammed last week trying to get a new Xbox.)

**AI influencing blurs the line between recommendation and manipulation.**

It gives brands permission to stop building community and start manufacturing attention.

When you use an AI influencer, here’s what you’re really saying:

- “I don’t trust people to like this on their own.”
- “I’d rather sell than serve.”
- “I’m okay with faking connection.”

I wonder if we’ll ever draw the line — but people can rationalize almost anything these days.

# TL;DR

Build something worth talking about.  
Something worth sharing.  
Something that genuinely makes someone’s life better.

When that happens, you won’t need a fake influencer.

Real humans will do it for you.
