**Creating Loyalty Through Value: Why Giving Away Dollars Isn't Enough**

In the competitive world of marketing, it’s easy to fall into the trap of discounts and cash incentives. I’ve ran plenty of deal based ads that serve the purpose of risk mitigation. But here’s the truth: anyone can offer a discount. Anyone can give away dollars. What truly makes a brand stand out is the value it provides beyond the transaction. Customers don’t just need an initial reason to try your product or service—they need a compelling reason to stay and pay.

### Why Discounts and Freebies Don’t directly build Loyalty

Discounts may drive short-term engagement, but they rarely foster long-term customer relationships. If the customer doesn’t feel right paying for the service upfront(and its already priced fairly), the customer really doesn’t have the problem to the degree of your product. (so its ‘overbuilt’, or this person is the wrong target audience) Instead of focusing on slashing prices, businesses should shift their focus to delivering value in a meaningful and memorable way for their top 20% of customers.

### Providing Value Through Product & Experience

Loyalty is built when customers feel they are gaining something beyond the financial incentive. This could be in the form of:

1. **A Superior Product Experience** – If your product solves a problem in a way no one else does, customers will keep coming back. Prioritize quality, innovation, and consistency over price cuts.
2. **Exclusive Access & Perks** – Offer customers something special that enhances their experience. Early access to new features, VIP treatment, or premium content can create an emotional connection that discounts cannot.
3. **Personalized Engagement** – People don’t just want a product; they want to feel seen and heard. A brand that engages with its customers, listens to their needs, and responds in meaningful ways creates lasting loyalty.
4. **Educational Content & Insights** – Providing customers with knowledge, whether through guides, workshops, or insider tips, positions your brand as a trusted resource rather than just another seller.
5. **A Sense of Community** – Brands that foster a loyal community win in the long run. Creating spaces—whether digital or in-person—where customers can connect, share experiences, and be a part of something bigger than just a transaction adds long-term value.

### Making Value a Core Strategy

Marketing efforts should focus on what customers will gain in their daily lives, not just in their wallets. Instead of running another “10% off” promotion, consider offering a free sample, a useful tool, or an enhanced customer experience.

Companies that commit to providing value rather than just discounts create lasting relationships. They don’t rely on temporary incentives but instead invest in making their customers' lives better. And when customers feel valued, they don’t just stay—they become loyal advocates who spread the word, driving organic growth far beyond any one-time discount could achieve.

At the end of the day, anyone can give away money. But brands that focus on giving away value—real, tangible, meaningful value—win in the long run.
