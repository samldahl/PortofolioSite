Building team culture isnâ€™t about controlling every detailâ€”itâ€™s about choosing battles wisely, empowering individuals, and making decisions based on data, not opinions.","imageSrc":"https://www.metabase.com/docs/latest/dashboards/images/dashboard.png","url":"https://samlerdahl.notion.site/Empowering-Data-191b7ad65ff880b29e33f334da0da2b6"},{"id":"2","title":"Designing for Developers","description":"Great UI/UX design isnâ€™t about aestheticsâ€”itâ€™s about solving problems efficiently and iteratively. The key to building an intuitive and effective user experience lies in deploying low-level strategies that deeply understand user needs, identify missing elements, and iterate quickly to ensure seamless functionality.","imageSrc":"https://i.imgur.com/JinYmLM.png","url":"https://samlerdahl.notion.site/The-best-experiences-191b7ad65ff8809bb63fc26033fe97ba"},{"id":"3","title":"Managing a better roadmap","description":"In a world where budgets vary and priorities shift, not everything should be expensive. The challenge in solution development isnâ€™t just about saying yes or noâ€”itâ€™s about saying yes to the right things while maintaining the flexibility to adapt as you learn more. This is where Agile development plays a critical role, allowing teams to make smart, calculated decisions that drive progress without overcommitting resources.","imageSrc":"https://i.imgur.com/YqMpetd.png","url":"https://samlerdahl.notion.site/Build-Small-Try-All-191b7ad65ff88027ab18c91e8017beb8"},{"id":"4","title":"Overbuilding hurts progress","description":"Saying no is one of the most undervalued and overlooked skills in business and life. Itâ€™s easy to believe that more is better, that adding just one more great idea will lead to success. But in reality, focusâ€”the ability to say noâ€”is what creates momentum, trust, and real progress.","imageSrc":"https://i.imgur.com/USB5C8O.jpeg","url":"https://samlerdahl.notion.site/The-Power-of-No-191b7ad65ff88066a4daef5b83b010b4"},{"id":"5","title":"Viral GrassRoots Growth","description":"In a world dominated by digital marketing and automated outreach, thereâ€™s something refreshingly powerful about getting back to the basicsâ€”connecting with people face-to-face and fostering real relationships.

Iâ€™ve ran plenty of deal based ads that serve the purpose of risk mitigation. But hereâ€™s the truth: anyone can offer a discount. Anyone can give away dollars. What truly makes a brand stand out is the value it provides beyond the transaction. Customers donâ€™t just need an initial reason to try your product or serviceâ€”they need a compelling reason to stay and pay.","imageSrc":"https://i.imgur.com/XUZx7qk.jpeg","url":"https://samlerdahl.notion.site/Avoid-paying-for-business-191b7ad65ff88053af2ce292c1848313"},{"id":"2702aec5-63a3-44a2-b699-4cf48c682603","title":"Being a leader everywhere","description":"Managing a team of 50+ engineers isnâ€™t just about delivering a competitive productâ€”itâ€™s about conducting a symphony of individual contributions, responsibilities, and motivations.
